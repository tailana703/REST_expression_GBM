# REST_expression_GBM
## Rationale

Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is a transcriptional repressor that has been identified as an oncogenic protein driving cell proliferation and migration in various brain tumor types, including neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma [PMID: 7697725; PMID: 23414932; PMID: 38609948]. However, not all the glioblastoma tumors are dependent on REST, hence predicting functional activity of this protein to identify high-REST tumors may represent a beneficial personalized treatment and/or prognosis strategy. 
In this project, we focused on the search of transcriptomic biomarkers predicting functional activity of REST among its target genes, followed by clustering samples into high- and low-REST to identify potential molecular pathways to be inhibited simultaneously with REST to achieve synergetic eradication of glioblastoma cells.
